IJP- A simple street view (JavaFx)
This is java application which which allows the user to move around and manipulate objects in a very simple “virtual world”. The images will be two-dimensional, but the user should be able to move from one location to another and to look in different directions - similar to Google “Street View”1, but with discrete images. Moreover, this application support pick and put items in the virtual world a bit similar to Pokemon.

This appication is implemented by using JavaFx.
