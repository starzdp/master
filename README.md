Imagine you are Google and you want to know which search queries (if any) form at least 1% of all queries in total. 
In the file queriesLarge.txt each line is a hash of a query and queries occurred in the order as listed in the file. 
Implement the lossy counting algorithm and run it on the file queriesLarge.txt. Your output should contain all queries 
that form at least 1% of all queries and no query that formed less than 0.9% of all queries.
